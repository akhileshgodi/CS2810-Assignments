One of the key constructs in object oriented programming is that of the
'interface'. The interface allows you to specify the essential functions
required for a task, without placing any constraints on how those
functions are implemented.

In this assignment, you will write two complex number class that
implements two interfaces; 
1. IComplex - A complex number interface that provides support for basic
   operations on complex numbers.
2. Comparable - A standard Java interface for the comparison of two
   objects

One of them (Complex) will use the "x + iy" representation, and the
other (PolarComplex) will use the "a e^{i \theta}". Implement
constructors that take arguments (re,im) and (abs,arg) respectively.
Extensive test cases have been provided to test functionality. When
creating your classes, remember to add "IComplex" and "Comparable" as
interfaces. Then proceed to implement each function. Also, remember to
run your class as a JUnit Test case.
