N-Queens
========

On a 8x8 chessboard, a queen can attack any piece in the same row, column or either diagonal. 

Given N, find a placement of N queens on an NxN chess board such that they can not attack each other. An example of such a solution is:

Print the coordinates in the standard chess style, i.e. a1 refers to the bottom left corner, and h8 the top right corner.

Example:
-------
Input: 
> 8

Output: 
> a2 b4 c6 d8 e3 f1 g7 h5

Note: There may be __many__ distinct solutions to the problem (e.g. the 8-queens problem has __92__ solutions). Any correct solution will do.
