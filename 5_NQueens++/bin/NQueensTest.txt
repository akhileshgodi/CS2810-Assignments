Test: N-Queens++
================

On a 8x8 chessboard, a queen can attack any piece in the same row,
column or either diagonal. In the previous assignment, you were required
to find a single placement of N queens on an NxN chessboard such that
they can not attack each other.

Now, given the coordinates of K queens, find *all* positions of the
remaining N-K queens. 

Note 1: This is a test. You are not allowed to look at your previous
submission, or browse online. If you have any questions regarding Java
or the assignment, ask your TA.

Note 2: You have been provided some test cases in the tests folder.
After creating an Eclipse project, create a Java class called "NQueens".
Copy the test folder and the "run_tests.sh" script into your project
folder. Now, if you run  "run_tests.sh" from the terminal, it will check
your program.

Example:
-------
Input: 
> 8
> 3
> 3 8 
> 4 1 
> 6 7 

Output: 
> a3 b6 c8 d1 e4 f7 g5 h2 
> a3 b6 c8 d1 e5 f7 g2 h4 
> a5 b2 c8 d1 e4 f7 g3 h6
